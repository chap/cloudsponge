## Description

Spread the word with an email invite. Import contacts from Yahoo, Hotmail, MSN, Gmail, AOL, Outlook and Mac Address Book.

## Features

### Problem

Websites looking to grow their customer base usually turn to traditional, paid methods of advertising like search engine keywords, media buys, and generic email lists. Though these methods can be effective at times, they are no match for the testimonial power your very own customers can bring. By encouraging your customers to promote your site to their family and friends, you have an inexpensive advertising channel to acquire customers. If one customer refers their friends, and their friends refer their friends, and so on, and so on, you now have a viral site!

### Solution

CloudSponge.com is THE tool you need to go viral! Here's how it works:

* Ask your customers to invite all their friends and family to your site.
* Use CloudSponge.com to pull your customer's contact list with their permission.
* Send an email invite to all the contacts provided by CloudSponge.com.
* Sit back and watch your customer base grow virally!

## Synopsis

### Usage:


    contacts = nil
    importer = Cloudsponge::ContactImporter.new(DOMAIN_KEY, DOMAIN_PASSWORD)
    resp = importer.begin_import('YAHOO')
    puts "Navigate to #{resp[:consent_url]} and complete the authentication process."
    loop do
      events = importer.get_events
      break unless events.select{ |e| e.is_error? }.empty?
      unless events.select{ |e| e.is_complete? }.empty?
        contacts = importer.get_contacts
        break
      end
    end
